### Development History

Project Inception: 2024-11-22

Initial Development Activities: 2024-11-23
- Downloaded ```Node.js``` to build ```React.js``` frontend app for deployment with ```Flask``` API in future.
  - This installs ```npm```, which can be used to run the server for the react app. Refer to the README file for more information in the ```src``` directory folder for the app.
- Built initial frontend features to understand how ```react.js``` script is used.
- When running on new machine before you can start the ```React.js``` frontend make sure to delete the ```package-lock.json``` in project folder and install react-scripts, dependencies, and then start the server:
```bash
npm install react-scripts
npm install
npm start
``` 
- Ensure you use the stand-alone terminal and not the one in VSCode
